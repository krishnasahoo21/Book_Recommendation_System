# Book-Recommendation-System
 
In this project, we worked on the Goodreads 10k dataset which contains six million ratings for ten thousand most popular books to
build a book recommendation system for a user based on book features and user rating. 
This solution could also be utilized for general recommendation problems. 
Some popular baseline approaches like collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and matrix factorization models for recommending books have been used for this project. We have also used advanced algorithms like neural networks to recommend books. â€‹All these systems combined are capable of creating a complete recommendation system for the Goodreads database.
